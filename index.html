      <h1>Privacy Policy — CHUCKL3</h1>
      <div class="meta">App by <strong>MAXHAX123</strong> &middot; Effective date: <strong>August 27, 2025</strong></div>
    </header>

    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Short version:</strong> CHUCKL3 itself runs entirely client-side and does not collect server-side personal data. However, third-party ads shown in the app may use their own trackers and collect data outside of CHUCKL3's control.
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>1. What this policy covers</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how CHUCKL3 (the "App") by MAXHAX123 handles information related to its users. It describes what data the App itself processes, and how third-party advertising partners may collect or process data when ads are displayed inside the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. App architecture & data handling</h2>
      <p>CHUCKL3 is a client-side application. That means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The App's main logic runs in the user's device/browser.</li>
        <li>No server-side user account or telemetry is collected by CHUCKL3 by default.</li>
        <li>Any data the App saves (settings, preferences, local caches) is stored locally on the user's device using browser storage mechanisms (e.g., localStorage, IndexedDB) unless you explicitly export or share data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Cookies & local storage</h2>
      <p>CHUCKL3 may use browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB) to remember user preferences and settings. These are stored locally and are not transmitted to a backend server by CHUCKL3 itself.</p>
      <p>The App does not set server-side cookies because it does not rely on a central server for normal operation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Third-party ads and trackers (important)</h2>
      <p>Although CHUCKL3's own code runs client-side, the App may display advertisements provided by third-party ad networks or platforms. These ad providers operate independently and may place cookies, use pixels, or employ other tracking technologies to deliver and measure ads. Examples of what third-party ad code may do (not exhaustive):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collect non-identifying device information (browser type, OS, screen size).</li>
        <li>Set or read cookies or local storage for ad personalization and frequency capping.</li>
        <li>Use fingerprinting techniques to recognize a device across sessions.</li>
        <li>Associate advertising activity with other services they operate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> These tracking activities are performed by the ad providers themselves and are outside the control of CHUCKL3 and MAXHAX123. If you wish to opt out of ad tracking, please review the privacy settings and opt-out mechanisms provided by the ad provider (often accessible via the ad or the provider's privacy center), or use browser-level privacy protections and ad-blocking tools.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Analytics & crash reporting</h2>
      <p>CHUCKL3 does not include any server-side analytics or crash reporting by default. If you enable optional features that integrate third-party analytics, those third-party services will be subject to their own privacy policies and data collection practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>Data stored locally by the App (preferences, saved sessions) remains on the user's device until the user deletes it, clears browser storage, or uninstalls the app. CHUCKL3 does not retain user data on any server by default.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Children</h2>
      <p>CHUCKL3 is not intended for children under 13. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information where applicable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Your rights & choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local data access:</strong> You can view, edit, export, or delete any data stored locally by the App using your browser or device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Opting out of ad tracking:</strong> To limit tracking by ad networks, use your device or browser privacy settings, enable "Do Not Track" where supported, or install ad-blocking/privacy extensions. Also check the ad's own controls (usually a small icon or "Ad choices" link on the ad).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect the client-side code and the integrity of data stored locally. However, no software is perfectly secure. You should avoid storing extremely sensitive personal information inside the App's local storage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes will be reflected with an updated "Effective date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or requests regarding data stored by the App, contact: <a href="mailto:maxwellvandijk62@gmail.com">maxwellvandijk62@gmail.com</a></p>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This document is a plain-language privacy statement to help users understand how CHUCKL3 behaves. It is not legal advice. If you require a legally binding privacy policy tailored to specific jurisdictions or business needs, consult a qualified attorney.</p>
